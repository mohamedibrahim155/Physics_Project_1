*************************************** Physics Project 1 ***************************************


INTRODUCTION :

This is our Project 1 Submission where we have to create a C++ program with the all necessary details given for the project

BUILDING AND RUNNING :

* Extract the .zip file amd you can find the project folder with this readme file
* Once you extracted the file you can run the solution and build my project in either Debug or Release
* Once building is done there will be a folder named x64 in the Solution Directory
* You need to copy and paste the ASSIMP DLL file near the .exe file and Paste all the necessary models and shaders
* Now you can run the program and see the results

NOTE : you have to paste everything in both Debug and Release folders, I'll Zip the necessary files. 
you can just extract the files and paste them inside the x64 file for debug and release

WHAT HAS BEEN DONE INSIDE THE PROJECT :

* We are simulating multiple (at least 10) spherical objects and updating using explicit 
  Newton-Euler forward integration.

* Sphere-Sphere collisions is being detected correctly.

* Sphere-Environment collisions is being detected and the environment is made up of mesh of triangles 

* The layout of the simulation has been defined in an external file

* The spheres fall off the environment, they will be re-introduced into the simulation.

* Covered all of the difficulty levels for the given project.


Group : This project is done by Uphendhra Nagarajan and Mohamed Ibrahim Shiek Dawood Salahudeen.
